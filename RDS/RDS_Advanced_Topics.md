# RDS Advanced Topics for DevOps Engineers 🚀

## 1. Multi-AZ Deployments 🌍
- *Automatic Failover*: Multi-AZ provides automated failover in case of a failure. A standby instance in another availability zone takes over automatically.
- *Use Case*: Production workloads that require high availability and automatic recovery during failure.

## 2. Read Replicas 📖
- *Horizontal Scaling*: Scale out read-heavy operations by creating read replicas across regions.
- *Asynchronous Replication*: Transactions are asynchronously replicated to replicas.
- *Use Case*: Offload read operations from the primary instance for better performance.

## 3. Performance Insights 📊
- *Performance Insights*: Visualize database load and understand which SQL queries are impacting performance.
- *Use Case*: DevOps teams troubleshooting slow queries or resource bottlenecks.

## 4. Automated Backups and Snapshots 💾
- *Automated Backups*: Automatically back up the database at a specified time.
- *Manual Snapshots*: Useful for point-in-time restores before major schema changes.
- *Use Case*: Scheduled, automated backups for mission-critical apps to ensure recoverability.
