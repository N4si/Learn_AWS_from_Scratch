## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to the **AWS Cloud From Scratch** repository! This repo is your go-to resource for building a solid foundation in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Whether you're just starting out or looking to sharpen your skills, you'll find everything you need here to get hands-on with the most crucial AWS services, particularly for a career in DevOps.

## 🗂 Overview of AWS Services Covered
This repository is structured into folders, each focusing on a key AWS service. Here's what you'll find:

**💻 [EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)](./EC2)**: Virtual servers to run your applications, with tutorials on instance management, Auto Scaling, and cost optimization.
  
- **📦 S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Scalable object storage for data backup, hosting static websites, and more.

- **🔐 IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manage user access and encryption keys securely.

- **🗄️ RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL with automatic backups and scaling.

- **🌐 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated network environments with subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.

- **🐳 ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Run and manage Docker containers at scale, including Fargate for serverless containers.

- **🎯 ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: Store, manage, and deploy Docker images easily and securely.

- **⚡ Lambda**: Serverless computing to run code in response to events without provisioning servers.

- **📜 CloudFormation**: Automate infrastructure deployment using templates for repeatable and scalable environments.

- **🔍 CloudWatch**: Monitor and observe your AWS resources and applications with metrics, logs, and alarms.

- **💬 SQS & SNS (Simple Queue Service & Simple Notification Service)**: Messaging services for decoupling and scaling applications.

- **📊 CloudTrail**: Track user activity and API usage across your AWS infrastructure for auditing and security.

- **🔑 Secrets Manager**: Securely store and manage sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.

- **🛡️ Load Balancer**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets for fault tolerance and high availability.

- **📈 Auto Scaling Group**: Automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand to maintain performance.

- **☸️ EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Managed Kubernetes to run containerized applications with ease.

Each folder contains hands-on tutorials, examples, and best practices to ensure you're ready to apply what you learn in real-world scenarios.
