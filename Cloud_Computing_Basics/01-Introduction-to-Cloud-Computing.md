# Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources over the internet. It allows you to access, store, and process data using remote servers rather than local hardware.

## Key Concepts

- **Cloud Computing**: Delivering computing services like servers, storage, databases, and software over the internet.
- **Virtualization**: Technology that allows you to create virtual (rather than physical) versions of resources.
- **Scalability**: Ability to easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

## Benefits

- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Flexibility**: Scale resources as needed.
- **Accessibility**: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.
