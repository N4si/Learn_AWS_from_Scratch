# AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are pre-configured templates used to create EC2 instances. They include the operating system, application server, and applications.

## Key Points

- **Creating an AMI**: Capture the state of your instance to create a reusable image.
- **Launching from AMI**: Quickly deploy new instances with the same configuration as the AMI.
- **Sharing AMIs**: Share your custom AMIs with other AWS accounts or make them public.

## Example Use Cases

- **Standardized Deployments**: Create an AMI with pre-installed software to ensure consistent deployments across multiple instances.
